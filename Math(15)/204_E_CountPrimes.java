/*
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Hint:
Let's start with a isPrime function. To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is not divisible
by any number less than n. The runtime complexity of isPrime function would be O(n) and hence counting the total
prime numbers up to n would be O(n2). Could we do better?
